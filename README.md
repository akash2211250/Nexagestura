# Nexagestura
NexaGestura is a gesture-based system for controlling volume and brightness using hand movements. It uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Python to track gestures in real-time, providing a seamless, touch-free experience. No extra hardware is needed—just a webcam! Future plans include custom gestures and voice integration. 🚀



NexaGestura 🎛️✨
Hands-Free Volume & Brightness Control Using Hand Gestures

📌 Overview
NexaGestura is an innovative project that enables touch-free control of volume and screen brightness using hand gestures. Built using computer vision and machine learning, it detects hand movements in real-time, offering a seamless and intuitive way to interact with devices.

🚀 Features
✅ Adjust volume and brightness with simple hand gestures
✅ Real-time hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe
✅ Smooth and accurate gesture recognition
✅ Works on standard webcams – no additional hardware required

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
OpenCV (for computer vision)
MediaPipe (for hand tracking)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Pycaw (for Windows audio control)
Screen-Brightness-Control (for brightness adjustments)

🎯 How It Works
The camera captures hand gestures.
The system detects key points on the hand.
Based on the movement, volume or brightness is adjusted smoothly.
